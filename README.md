Radioisotope growth and decay predicted using forward Euler integration

This software is written using the R language and is intended to demonstrate a neutron-activation driven isotope growth and decay chain. Initial conditions for each isotope under investigation can be specified. Additional growth or decay channels can be implemented as additional differential equations, as required.

Please cite this software if you use it.
